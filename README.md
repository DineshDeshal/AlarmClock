Python Alarm Clock
The objective of this project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. We’ll use the datetime and tkinter libraries to build the project. The alarm clock will allow users to set alarms in a 24-hour format through an intuitive user interface.

Prerequisites
Python GUI (Tkinter): Tkinter is the most commonly used technique for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. It provides a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python.
Winsound: The winsound module provides access to sound-playing functionality on Windows platforms. We’ll use it to play the alarm sound.
Time and Datetime: These modules help us manage time-related functions and access attributes associated with dates, times, and time zones.


Implementation Steps
Import Required Libraries:
Python

from tkinter import *
import datetime
import time
import winsound
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Create GUI Elements:
Add buttons, labels, frames, and option menus to create an intuitive interface. We’ll create a three-option menu for hours (00–24), minutes (00–60), and seconds (00–60).


Create an Infinite Loop:
Get hours, minutes, and seconds values from the user.
Wait for one second using the time module.
Get the current time using the datetime module.
Check if the current time matches the set alarm time; play the alarm sound.
